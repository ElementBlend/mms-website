# MmsWebsite

This is a website for Discord Minecraft Modding Survival Server use.  
This is a rewritten version of the original PHP website using a modern Angular web application framework and more bug fixes.

## Setup

1. Install [Node.jsÂ® and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if they are not already on your machine.
2. Install the Angular CLI globally with `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
